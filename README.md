# Description
<!-- Section that clearly presents the project, including its goal and a brief overview. -->
A high-speed inter-process communication project. The goal is to transmit strings between a client and a server using only UNIX signals.

### Technical prerequisites
- Bit-by-bit transmission via SIGUSR1 (representing 0) and SIGUSR2 (representing 1).
- Instantaneous output. Must handle 100+ characters per second.
- The server must stay alive and handle multiple clients sequentially

### Bonus features
- ACK System: server sends a signal back to the client for every bit received, preventing data loss.
- Unicode Support: full UTF-8 compatibility.

# Instructions
<!-- section containing any relevant information about compilation, installation, and/or execution. -->
### Compilation and execution
1. `make`
2. `./server` to show PID
3. `./client [SERVER PID] "String to send"`

_NB: this project was desgined to be ran on a little-endian environment._

### AI Usage (Gemini 3)
- Helped me better understand how bitwise operators work. Had trouble understanding that `character_int >> 7 & 1` was really just comparing the 7th bit of `character_int` to `1`.
- Helped me troubleshoot a memory allocation issue: `encoded = (char **)malloc((sizeof(char) ...)` instead of `encoded = (char **)malloc((sizeof(char *) ...)` for a 2d array... also gave me a tip: `encoded = (char **)malloc((sizeof(*encoded) ...)`.
- Helped me find other ways than ugly infinite loops to wait for signals: `pause()` and `sigsuspend()`.
- Hinted me to understand how `signal()` and `sigaction()` are different and made sense of the manual of `sigaction()` for me.
